Greetings everyone.

I have the pleasure to invite you on the dedicated SMONSTER slack server.

In order to connect, i will send you an invitation via Email,
on the same email than the one you are using on Gumroad.

So please be sure that you are not missing any mail,
coming from my email address: f-an-k-studio@live.com
(check your whitelist for this.)

For security reason, the first time you will get connected on the Slack server,
i will ask you for the License key that is linked to your SMONSTER V2.
(you can find it in your gumroad library when you click on the product. https://gumroad.com/library)

I'll get back to you soon with more videos and help via the website and via Slack.

Again, thanks a lot for your support.
Take care.

Franck Elisabeth
