You need at least Modo 14.1 to run 100 % of the scripts included.
I try to keep compatibility from 13.0 to 14.0.
As usual if you fiond a bug, please reach me out on SNS and i will do my best to help you and fix this.

======> You ALWAYS need to have SMO_MASTER ans SMOONSTER Kit up and running to use the command in the kit <======

As for every Product / Art piece / Assets that you do, like everyone of us,
please do not share those files, as you didn't want to see your work shared
on internet without your permission.
                 I'm sure you'll understand that point.
