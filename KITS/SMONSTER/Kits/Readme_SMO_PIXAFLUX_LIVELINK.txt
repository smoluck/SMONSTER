It's a Pie menu , you'll access to it by pressing:

CTRL + ALT + Shift + P

if you want to change the Hotkey:
	You'll need to edit the hotkey via the Form editor or by editing directly this file:
	SMO_PIXAFLUX_LIVELINK\Configs\SMO_PixaFlux_LL_Keymap.CFG
OR
	You can do that in Modo Via the Tail Button, by Holding Ctrl and click you can now define your own Keymap to launch the livelink.

(You need to be using Modo under windows in order to use that kit, as Pixaflux wasn't tested under Mac.)

As for every Product / Art piece / Assets that you do like everyone of us,
please do not share those files, as you didn't want to see your work shared
on internet without your permission.
I'm sure you'll understand that point.
