# SMONSTER
Hi everyone.

Today I'm releasing the SMONSTER Kit to public for both Freelance or Studios.
- This kit is production ready.
- If you want to contribute to the development you can.
- Give financial support, i'd appreciated that.

***I must be precise that I will still add things to it in a near future, so please don't consider it as an abandon-ware. I've spent too many times building it to let it go.***


# DETAILS
SMONSTER include 15 Standard Kits (including 2 Beta Kits) and 3 Livelink Kits to simplify integration of other software within Modo and improve your workflow.

`SMONSTER Kit` + `TRAINING kit`

- Now SMONSTER consist of the [SOURCE](https://smoluck.gumroad.com/l/Smonster-v3) Kit + [TRAINING](https://smoluck.gumroad.com/l/SMONSTER_TRAINING) Kit as 2 zip archive. SMONSTER TRAINING Kit is now a separate kit. It contains all the training files.


It's been about 5 years now that i've started to learn Python Scripting over my spare time. It was a though work for a simple 3D Artist, but i won't regret anything i've discovered during that time. It was a great journey, along those years and i will continue to explore that as a Technical Artist.
I've wrapped up about ~250 commands for Modo along many other scripts and UI development.
[MODO](https://www.foundry.com/products/modo) is a hub for me since 2006 and i've got plenty of pleasure using it along other tools.
Some have been so important to my pipeline that i've integrated some Livelink kits for them, like [RizomUV](https://www.rizom-lab.com/), [Marmoset Toolbag](https://marmoset.co/toolbag/) or [Pixaflux](http://pixaflux.com/).
2 Beta kits are dedicated to [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html) and Point Cloud workflow. 

To use it at your profit, you can install it in two ways:
- from [GitHub](https://github.com/smoluck/SMONSTER/blob/main/README.md#building-the-kit-from-github)
- from Gumroad for [SMONSTER Kit](https://smoluck.gumroad.com/l/Smonster-v3) and [TRAINING Kit](https://smoluck.gumroad.com/l/SMONSTER_TRAINING)

You need at least Modo `15.0` to run `100 %` of the scripts included.

`You ALWAYS need to have SMO_MASTER ans SMOONSTER Kit up and running to use the commands in the kit`
