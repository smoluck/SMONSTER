# SMONSTER
Hi everyone.

Today i'm releasing the Smonster Kit to public for both Freelance or Studios. SMONSTER kit is production ready.
(I must precise that i will still add things to it in a near future, so plase don't consider it as an abandonware. I've spent too many time building it to let it go.)

It's been about 5 years now that i've started to learn Python Scripting over my spare time. It was a though work for a simple 3D Artist, but i won't regret anything i've discovered during that time. It was a great journey, along those years and i will continue to explore that as a Technical Artist.
I've wrapped up about ~250 commands for Modo along many other scripts and UI development.
[MODO](https://www.foundry.com/products/modo) is a hub for me since 2006 and i've got plenty of pleasure using it along other tools.
Some have been so important to my pipeline that i've integrated some Livelink kits for them, like [RizomUV](https://www.rizom-lab.com/), [Marmoset Toolbag](https://marmoset.co/toolbag/) or [Pixaflux](http://pixaflux.com/). 

To use it at your profit, you can Clone that repository and build the LPK or get it from my [Gumroad](https://smoluck.gumroad.com/l/Smonster-v3).
Enjoy the tools and please give some feedback on Foundry Forum thread or preferably via our [Dedicated Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/smonster/shared_invite/zt-1dkpid10n-QK4gn4UAk6iG5wv7ISEdnQ).

Thanks to the wonderfull Modo community and the [PixelFondue](https://www.pixelfondue.com/) Contributor Team that have gave me a lot of support on this achievement.

Best regards, Franck Elisabeth.

# DISCLAIMER
You need at least Modo `15.0` to run `100 %` of the scripts included.
I try to keep compatibility from `15.0` to `16.X`.
As usual if you found a bug, please reach me out on SNS and i will do my best to help you and fix this.

`You ALWAYS need to have SMO_MASTER ans SMOONSTER Kit up and running to use the commands in the kit`
